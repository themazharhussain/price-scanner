      question: 'Can I get alerts for specific products?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely! You can create personalized price alerts by selecting the products youâ€™re interested in. Simply set your desired target price, and the app will notify you through push notifications or email when the price drops to your specified amount, helping you make timely purchase decisions.',

      question: 'How accurate are the price alerts?',
      answer:
        'Price alerts are highly accurate, leveraging real-time data from retailers.
